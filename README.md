  <h1>The Brain-Diet Connection</h1>

  <p>
    A 2023 study published in *The Lancet* revealed that individuals who lost 10% of their body weight through diet reduced their dementia risk by 28%. This link between metabolic health and cognitive function is drawing more scientific attention.

  <p>
    Excess weight increases inflammation, insulin resistance, and damages small brain vessels. Visceral fat releases cytokines that pass the blood-brain barrier, while high blood sugar harms cerebral circulation.

  <h2>How Diet Weight Loss Protects the Brain</h2>

  <p><strong>Metabolic Optimization:</strong> Johns Hopkins found that a 7% weight loss boosts brain glucose metabolism by 22%, preventing energy deficits.</p>

  <p><strong>Inflammation Reduction:</strong> Nature Aging reports each 5kg loss reduces inflammation markers like IL-6 by 18%, limiting amyloid plaque formation.</p>

  <p><strong>Vascular Protection:</strong> The Framingham Study noted a 10â€“12 mmHg drop in systolic pressure improves brain blood flow after weight loss.</p>

  <h2>Which Diets Work Best?</h2>

  <p>
    Mediterranean and MIND diets offer strong evidence, combining weight loss with nutrients like omega-3s and polyphenols that support brain health.
  </p>

  <h2>Simple Strategies to Try</h2>

  <p>
    Prioritize fatty fish, leafy greens, and berries. Consider time-restricted eating and pair weight loss efforts with cognitive exercises such as learning a new skill.
